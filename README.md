# üß± Mosaic: Mantle Smart Contract Builder

## üåü Overview

Mosaic is an innovative smart contract development platform specifically designed for the Mantle blockchain ecosystem. It offers two powerful approaches to contract creation: a visual drag-and-drop builder and an AI-powered contract generator. Whether you prefer hands-on composition or AI assistance, Mosaic empowers developers and blockchain enthusiasts to rapidly create and deploy optimized smart contracts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Visual Contract Builder
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for composing contracts
- Pre-built, Mantle-optimized contract modules
- Real-time Solidity code generation
- Component-based architecture for maximum reusability

### AI Contract Generator
- Powered by Llama 3.2 8B parameter model via Gaia
- Natural language contract generation
- Context-aware code completion
- Mantle-specific optimizations and best practices

### Example AI Prompts
Here are some effective prompts to help you get started with the AI generator:

```
"Create an ERC20 token contract for a community rewards system with:
- Monthly distribution caps
- Vesting schedules for team tokens
- Anti-whale mechanisms limiting large transfers"
```

```
"Design a meta-transaction handler for my DeFi protocol that:
- Supports percentage-based gas fee delegation
- Includes signature verification
- Has role-based permissions for gas sponsors"
```

```
"Generate a bridge adapter contract that:
- Handles ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum and Mantle
- Includes emergency pause functionality
- Implements a challenge period for withdrawals"
```

### Supported Contract Components

Both the visual builder and AI generator support:
- Meta Transaction Handlers
- ERC20 Token Implementations
- Role-Based Access Control
- Bridge Adapters
- Gas Optimization Utilities
- NFT Contract Templates

### Deployment Options
- One-click deployment to Mantle Mainnet
- Streamlined testing on Mantle Sepolia Testnet
- Seamless MetaMask integration
- Built-in gas estimation and optimization
